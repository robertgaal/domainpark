domainpark
==========

A tiny app that let's you park your domain names at Heroku. Simply create this as a new app on Heroku, and [add custom domains to it](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains). This works great if your registrar charges you for a redirect, or if you just like Heroku as an interface for this.
